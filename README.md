Today's lecture is based on the excellent graph machine learning course by Jure Leskovec, which you can find [here](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224w/). It is open source and provides [recordings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAB_plj2rbA&list=PLoROMvodv4rOP-ImU-O1rYRg2RFxomvFp), so if you want to dive deeper into graph-based learning than we can cover today, this would be a good place to start.

In addition, this [interactive tutorial](https://distill.pub/2021/gnn-intro/) made by Google researchers is a good introduction to many of the intuitions behind Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We will use the interactive parts as additional explanations in today's course, so it is a good idea to have this page open in a tab at all times.

There are great tutorials about a number of different GNN applications on the [PyTorch Geometric site](https://www.pyg.org/blogs-and-tutorials.nspx).
